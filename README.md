# Advent of Code 2023

I am participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023 and learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

To run the solution, `cd` into the directory for the day and run `cargo run`. The solution will be printed to the console. `input.txt` should be in the `src` directory.
